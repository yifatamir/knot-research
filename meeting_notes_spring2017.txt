-cubic b-spline for a polyline uses four points to compute the curve between the points.
-cost function: 3 parts
	1. deviation from unit length
	2. deviation from 30*
	3. deviation from blue trefoil polyline
-trefoil knot, 8 figure knot
-make b-spline
-sliders (use symmetry to minimize number of sliders)
