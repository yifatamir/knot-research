Knot-View
+++++++++

This is a simple viewer for knots or closed curves specified by a piece-wise linear poly-line control polygon,
and implemented as a cubic B-spline.
The control points are specified in a simple text file "<YOUR-VERTICES>.text"
where you place three numbers on each line, representing x-, y- and z-ccordinates of the control points.
The last point entered is automatically connected to the first point.

Once you have established such a text file, just drag the file icon onto  "KnotView-3D.exe"
and the application will then open and display your curve.
Use the LEFT-mouse button for crystal-ball orientation changes;
use the RIGHT-mouse button for repositioning the object;
use (LEFT-mouse+RIGHT-mouse) up- and down-drag to zoom-in and zoom-out.

In the "KnotCP CP" menue you can change various aspects of the display,
such as the thicknesses of the knot-curve, of the control poly-line, and of the "ribs" 
(as well as their number) denoting consecutive sampling points along the curve.
You can also change the coloring of the display.
